# NAME OF YOUR GAME

## Descriptions

Briefly describe the premise of your game to give potential players a sense of what it will be like to play.

My game will be a shopping game where the goal is to buy the things needed for the week, and some things you want, while staying in the budget. There will also be opportunities to get discounts if enough things are bought in certain catagories. There will also be some game over screens if the wrong things are bought, or money runs out. I will use the pygame module to add sounds. I will be doing this in VS code.

## Flow chart

Sketch a flow chart of your game. What are the options the user can choose between, and where will those choices lead them? You might want to draw this on paper, take a picture, and upload that here.
